        <h1>Character of Discharge Requirements</h1>
        <section class="intro-section">
          <p class="lead">To receive Veterans' Preference, your discharge from active duty must meet specific requirements. Understanding these requirements is crucial for determining your eligibility.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Basic Requirement</h2>
          <p>To be eligible for Veterans' Preference, a veteran must have been <strong>discharged or released from active duty in the Armed Forces under honorable conditions</strong>. This means you must have received either: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>An honorable discharge</li>
            <li>A general discharge (under honorable conditions)</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="important-note">
            <h3>Important</h3>
            <p>The discharge characterization shown on your DD Form 214 or equivalent discharge documentation determines your eligibility.</p>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Qualifying Discharge Types</h2>
          <h3>Honorable Discharge</h3>
          <p>Veterans who received an honorable discharge meet the character of service requirement for Veterans' Preference. This is the highest form of discharge and indicates that you met or exceeded the required standards of duty performance and personal conduct.</p>
          <h3>General Discharge (Under Honorable Conditions)</h3>
          <p>Veterans who received a general discharge under honorable conditions also meet the character of service requirement. While your service may have been satisfactory overall, some aspect didn't meet the standards for an honorable discharge.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Non-Qualifying Discharge Types</h2>
          <p>The following types of discharge do NOT qualify for Veterans' Preference:</p>
          <h3>Other Than Honorable (OTH) Discharge</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Veterans with OTH discharges are not eligible for Veterans' Preference</li>
            <li>You may be able to upgrade your discharge through a military discharge review board</li>
            <li>Some VA benefits may still be available depending on the circumstances</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Bad Conduct Discharge</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Issued by a court-martial</li>
            <li>Does not qualify for Veterans' Preference</li>
            <li>Discharge upgrades may be possible in limited circumstances</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Dishonorable Discharge</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The most severe form of discharge</li>
            <li>Does not qualify for Veterans' Preference</li>
            <li>Very limited possibilities for upgrade</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Special Situations</h2>
          <h3>Uncharacterized or Entry Level Separation</h3>
          <p>If you received an uncharacterized discharge or entry-level separation (typically given to service members separated within the first 180 days), your eligibility depends on additional factors. You may need to provide additional documentation to establish eligibility.</p>
          <h3>National Guard and Reserve Service</h3>
          <p>For National Guard and Reserve members, the discharge must be from a period of active duty (not active duty for training) to qualify for preference, unless you have a service-connected disability.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Documentation Required</h2>
          <p>To verify your character of discharge, you'll need to provide:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>DD Form 214</strong> (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty) - This is the primary document showing your discharge characterization
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Alternative documentation</strong> if DD-214 is unavailable: <ul>
                <li>Military discharge certificate</li>
                <li>NGB Form 22 (for National Guard members)</li>
                <li>Statement of Service letter from your branch</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Discharge Upgrades</h2>
          <p>If you received a discharge that doesn't qualify for Veterans' Preference, you may be able to apply for a discharge upgrade through:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Discharge Review Board (DRB)</strong> - Reviews discharges less than 15 years old
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Board for Correction of Military Records (BCMR)</strong> - Can review any discharge regardless of age
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>Tip</h3>
            <p>Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs) can provide free assistance with discharge upgrade applications.</p>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Key Points to Remember</h2>
          <ul class="key-points">
            <li>Only honorable and general (under honorable conditions) discharges qualify</li>
            <li>Your DD-214 is the primary proof of discharge characterization</li>
            <li>OTH, Bad Conduct, and Dishonorable discharges do not qualify</li>
            <li>Discharge upgrades may be possible through review boards</li>
            <li>Character of discharge is just one requirement - you must also meet service requirements</li>
          </ul>
