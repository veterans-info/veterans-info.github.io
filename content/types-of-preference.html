            <h2>Types of Preference</h2>
            <p>Veterans' Preference is categorized into different types based on the nature of service and any service-connected disabilities. The primary types are 5-point and 10-point preference.</p>
            <h3>5-Point Preference (TP)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Generally granted to veterans who served during certain periods or in certain campaigns, but do not have a service-connected disability.</li>
                <li>Requires honorable discharge.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>10-Point Preference</h3>
            <p>This is further divided into several sub-categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>10-Point Compensable Disability (CP):</strong> For veterans who have a service-connected disability of 10% or more.</li>
                <li><strong>10-Point Compensable Disability, Schedular (CPS):</strong> For veterans who have a service-connected disability of 30% or more.</li>
                <li><strong>10-Point Other (XP):</strong> For veterans who are Purple Heart recipients or have certain other specific service-connected conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>10-Point Derived Preference (SSP):</strong> For spouses, mothers, or guardians of veterans who are unable to use their preference due to disability or death.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For detailed criteria and specific requirements for each type of preference, please consult the <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/veterans-services/vet-guide-for-hr-professionals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals</a>.</p>
