            <h2>Types of Preference</h2>
            <p>Veterans' preference is categorized into two main types: 5-point preference and 10-point preference, with various sub-categories under the latter. The type of preference a veteran is eligible for depends on their service history, disability status, and in some cases, the status of their family members.</p>
            
            <h3>5-Point Preference (TP - "Ten Point")</h3>
            <p>Generally granted to veterans who served during certain periods or in specific campaigns, but do not have a service-connected disability. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Veterans who served on active duty for more than 180 consecutive days, any part of which occurred after January 31, 1955, and before October 15, 1976.</li>
                <li>Veterans who served on active duty for more than 180 consecutive days, any part of which occurred during the period beginning August 2, 1990, and ending on January 2, 1992.</li>
                <li>Veterans who served on active duty for more than 180 consecutive days, any part of which occurred during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>10-Point Preference</h3>
            <p>This preference is granted to veterans with service-connected disabilities or those who meet specific criteria related to combat or Purple Heart recipients. There are several sub-categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CPS (Compensable Disability, 10-point, 30% or more):</strong> Veterans who have a service-connected disability of 30% or more.</li>
                <li><strong>CP (Compensable Disability, 10-point, less than 30%):</strong> Veterans who have a service-connected disability of less than 30%.</li>
                <li><strong>XP (Preference Eligible, 10-point, Other):</strong> This category includes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Veterans who received a Purple Heart.</li>
                        <li>Veterans who were honorably discharged from active duty and who served in a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized, and who are entitled to disability compensation under laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs or to retired pay under title 10, U.S.C., by reason of a service-connected disability.</li>
                        <li>Certain spouses, widows, and mothers of veterans (derivative preference).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
