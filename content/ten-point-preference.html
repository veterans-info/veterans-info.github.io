            <h2>10-Point Preference (CP, CPS, XP)</h2>
            <p>Ten-point preference is granted to veterans with service-connected disabilities, Purple Heart recipients, and certain spouses, widows, or mothers of veterans. This preference adds ten points to their earned score on federal civil service examinations.</p>
            
            <h3>Types of 10-Point Preference:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CP (Compensable Disability, 10 Points):</strong> For veterans who have a compensable service-connected disability of 10% or more.</li>
                <li><strong>CPS (Compensable Disability, Spousal Preference, 10 Points):</strong> For spouses of veterans who are unable to work due to a service-connected disability, or spouses of deceased veterans who died of a service-connected disability.</li>
                <li><strong>XP (Non-Compensable Disability or Purple Heart, 10 Points):</strong> For veterans with a non-compensable service-connected disability or those who received a Purple Heart.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Eligibility Criteria:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Service-Connected Disability:</strong> A disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is required for CP and CPS.</li>
                <li><strong>Purple Heart:</strong> Receipt of the Purple Heart medal.</li>
                <li><strong>Relationship to Veteran:</strong> For derivative preference (CPS), proof of relationship and the veteran's disability or death is necessary.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Documentation required typically includes a DD Form 214 and a VA letter confirming disability rating or other relevant documentation.
