            <h2>Derivative Preference for Spouses and Family Members</h2>
            <p>In certain circumstances, Veterans' Preference can be "derived" by spouses, widows, or mothers of veterans who would have been eligible for preference but are unable to use it themselves due to specific conditions.</p>
            
            <h3>Eligibility for Derivative Preference:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spouses of Disabled Veterans (CPS):</strong> The spouse of a veteran who has a service-connected disability and is unable to use their preference due to the nature of their disability.</li>
                <li><strong>Unmarried Widows/Widowers of Veterans:</strong> The unmarried widow or widower of a veteran who died while on active duty in the armed forces, or who died after separation from service from a service-connected disability.</li>
                <li><strong>Mothers of Deceased or Disabled Veterans:</strong> The mother of a veteran who died while on active duty in a war or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized, or the mother of a veteran who has a permanent and total service-connected disability. In both cases, the mother must be living with her spouse who is totally and permanently disabled, or she must be unmarried.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Considerations:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Derivative preference is typically a 10-point preference.</li>
                <li>Extensive documentation is required to prove the veteran's eligibility and the relationship to the veteran, as well as the specific circumstances (e.g., veteran's disability status, death certificate).</li>
                <li>The veteran themselves must have been eligible for preference.</li>
            </ul>
