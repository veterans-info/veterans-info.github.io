          <h2>How 5-Point Preference Works</h2>
          <h3>In Competitive Examinations</h3>
          <p>When agencies use numerical scoring:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>5 points are added to your passing score</li>
            <li>Example: If you score 85 on an exam, your final score is 90</li>
            <li>You must first achieve a passing score (usually 70) to receive the points</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>In Category Rating</h3>
          <p>When agencies use category rating:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Preference eligibles are listed ahead of non-preference eligibles in each quality category</li>
            <li>Points are not added, but preference still provides an advantage</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>In Reduction in Force (RIF)</h3>
          <p>5-point preference eligibles receive:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Higher retention standing than non-veterans</li>
            <li>Placement in retention subgroup A</li>
          </ul>
