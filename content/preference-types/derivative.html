            <h1>Derivative Preference (10-Point XP)</h1>

            <section class="intro-section">
                <p class="lead">Derivative preference extends Veterans' Preference benefits to certain eligible family members when the veteran is unable to use the preference themselves due to a qualifying service-connected disability or death. This 10-point preference (coded as XP) recognizes the profound sacrifices made by veterans' families.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Who Can Receive Derivative Preference?</h2>
                <p>Derivative preference is potentially available to three categories of family members:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spouses of certain disabled or deceased veterans.</li>
                    <li>Unremarried widows and widowers of certain deceased veterans.</li>
                    <li>Mothers of certain deceased or disabled veterans.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="important-note">
                    <h3>Important Co-Eligibility Note</h3>
                    <p>It's possible for both a mother and a spouse (or unremarried widow/widower) to be entitled to preference based on the same veteran's service if they each meet the respective eligibility requirements. However, neither may receive preference if the veteran is living AND is qualified for (and able to use) their own preference for Federal employment.</p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Spouse Eligibility (XP)</h2>
                <p>A spouse may receive 10-point derivative preference if the veteran is living but is disqualified for a Federal position along the general lines of their usual occupation because of a service-connected disability. This disqualification may be presumed when:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The veteran has a service-connected disability rated by the VA as 100% permanent and total, OR</li>
                    <li>The veteran has a VA service-connected disability rating that includes individual unemployability, OR</li>
                    <li>The veteran has retired or resigned from a civil service position due to a service-connected disability that is compensable, OR</li>
                    <li>The veteran has attempted to obtain a civil service position but failed to qualify for appointment because of a service-connected disability.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Additional Requirements for Spouses:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Must be legally married to the veteran at the time of application for preference.</li>
                    <li>The veteran must be living.</li>
                    <li>The veteran's service-connected disability must be the reason they cannot work in their usual occupation.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="tip">
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This Veterans' Preference for spouses is distinct from, and has different requirements than, spouse preference programs within the Department of Defense (DoD) for military spouses seeking DoD civilian employment.</p>

            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Widow/Widower Eligibility (XP)</h2>
                <p>An unremarried widow or widower of a deceased veteran may receive 10-point derivative preference if:</p>
                
                <h3>Marriage and Remarriage Requirements:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Was legally married to the veteran at the time of the veteran's death.</li>
                    <li>Was not divorced from the veteran.</li>
                    <li>Has not remarried. If the widow/widower remarried, eligibility is lost unless that subsequent marriage was annulled.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Veteran's Service or Death Circumstances:</h3>
                <p>The deceased veteran must have either:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Served on active duty during a war, or during the period April 28, 1952, through July 1, 1955, OR</li>
                    <li>Served in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal has been authorized, OR</li>
                    <li>Died while on active duty (even if not during a war or campaign period), provided the death occurred under conditions that would not have been the basis for other than an honorable or general discharge (e.g., not due to willful misconduct).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If the veteran's death was service-connected, these service period requirements may not apply. Check SF-15 instructions.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Mother Eligibility (XP)</h2>
                <p>A mother of a veteran may receive derivative preference under specific circumstances related to the veteran's death or disability, and her own marital and dependency status.</p>
                
                <h3>Mother of a Deceased Veteran:</h3>
                <p>If the veteran son or daughter died under honorable conditions while on active duty during:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A war, OR</li>
                    <li>The period April 28, 1952, through July 1, 1955, OR</li>
                    <li>A campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal was authorized.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Mother of a Disabled Veteran:</h3>
                <p>If the veteran son or daughter was separated with an honorable or general discharge from active duty and is permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected injury or illness.</p>

                <h3>Additional Requirements for Mothers:</h3>
                <p>The mother must also meet these conditions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Is or was married to the father of the veteran.</li>
                    <li>AND one of the following applies to her current status:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Her husband (either the veteran's father or her husband through remarriage) is totally and permanently disabled.</li>
                            <li>She is widowed, divorced, or legally separated from the veteran's father and has not remarried.</li>
                            <li>She remarried, but is now widowed, divorced, or legally separated from her subsequent husband at the time she claims preference.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>(Essentially, the mother must demonstrate a current or past dependency or hardship related to her marital status and the veteran's father or her current spouse, in addition to the veteran's qualifying service/disability/death.)</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Required Documentation</h2>
                <p>All derivative preference applicants must submit the following, in addition to specific documents for their category:</p>

                </ul>

                <h3>Specific Documentation by Claimant Type:</h3>

                <h2>Important Limitations and Considerations</h2>
                <div class="important-note">
                    <h3>Key Restrictions on Derivative Preference</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Preference is generally not granted to widows or mothers of veterans whose only qualifying service was "peacetime" service after May 7, 1975 (end of Vietnam War era for preference) unless the veteran died on active duty or became permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected condition.</li>
                        <li>Children of veterans are NOT eligible for derivative preference under any circumstances.</li>
                        <li>A family member cannot typically receive derivative preference if the veteran is living, qualified for Federal employment, and able to use their own preference.</li>
                        <li>Remarriage generally terminates eligibility for widows/widowers, unless the subsequent marriage is annulled.</li>
                        <li>Eligibility for mothers can be complex due to marital status and dependency requirements.</li>
                    </ul>

            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>How Derivative Preference Works in Practice</h2>
                <p>If granted, derivative preference provides the same 10-point (XP) benefits as if the veteran were claiming it directly (for non-CPS scenarios):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>10 points are added to a passing score in competitive examinations (when numerical scoring is used).</li>
                    <li>The applicant is listed ahead of non-preference eligibles and 5-point preference eligibles with the same score.</li>
                    <li>Provides higher retention standing in Reduction in Force (RIF) situations.</li>
                    <li>Derivative preference does not "expire" as long as the individual continues to meet all eligibility criteria (e.g., a widow remains unremarried).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common Questions</h2>
                
                <div class="tip">
                    <h3>Q: Can both the veteran's surviving spouse (widow/widower) and the veteran's mother claim derivative preference based on the same veteran?</h3>
                    <p>A: Yes, it is possible if both individuals independently meet all the specific eligibility requirements for their respective categories (widow/widower or mother).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="tip">
                    <h3>Q: The veteran has a VA disability rating of 70% and works part-time. Can their spouse claim derivative preference?</h3>
                    <p>A: Generally, no. For a spouse of a living veteran to be eligible, the veteran must be disqualified from working in positions along the general lines of their usual occupation *because of* their service-connected disability. A 100% P&T rating or individual unemployability from VA usually satisfies this. A 70% rating, especially if the veteran is still working, typically means the veteran is not considered disqualified for preference purposes, so the spouse would not be eligible.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="tip">
                    <h3>Q: I am the widow of a veteran and I remarried, but my second husband passed away. Am I eligible for derivative preference again?</h3>
                    <p>A: No. Once a widow/widower remarries, eligibility for derivative preference based on the prior veteran spouse is permanently terminated, unless the remarriage was legally annulled. The death of the subsequent spouse does not restore eligibility.</p>
