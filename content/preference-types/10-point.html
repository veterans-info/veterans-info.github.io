        <h1>10-Point Veterans' Preference</h1>
        <section class="intro-section">
          <p class="lead">10-point preference provides the highest level of Veterans' Preference, adding ten points to passing scores (when numerical scoring is used) and providing additional protections in federal hiring. It is available to disabled veterans, Purple Heart recipients, and certain eligible family members.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Types of 10-Point Preference</h2>
          <h3>10-Point Compensable Disability (CP)</h3>
          <h4>Who Qualifies:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Veterans with a VA service-connected disability rating of at least 10% but less than 30%.</li>
            <li>Must have served on active duty at any time (no wartime service requirement).</li>
            <li>Must have received an honorable or general discharge.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Key Benefits:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>10 points added to a passing score in examinations.</li>
            <li>Placed ahead of non-preference eligibles and 5-point preference eligibles with the same score.</li>
            <li>Additional protections in Reduction in Force (RIF).</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>10-Point 30% Compensable Disability (CPS)</h3>
          <h4>Who Qualifies:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Veterans with a VA service-connected disability rating of 30% or more.</li>
            <li>Must have served on active duty at any time (no wartime service requirement).</li>
            <li>Must have received an honorable or general discharge.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Key Benefits:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>10 points added to a passing score in examinations.</li>
            <li>Placed at the top of most civil service examination registers (except for scientific/professional positions at GS-9 and above).</li>
            <li>Special protections against being "passed over" by a selecting official.</li>
            <li>Enhanced RIF protections (highest retention subgroup).</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>10-Point Disability or Derived Preference (XP)</h3>
          <p>This category covers several groups:</p>
          <h4>Who Qualifies:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Veterans who received the Purple Heart.</li>
            <li>Veterans with a VA service-connected disability rated less than 10% (i.e., 0% compensable).</li>
            <li>Veterans receiving VA non-service-connected disability pension benefits.</li>
            <li>Veterans who received disability retirement from the military (not VA disability compensation).</li>
            <li>Eligible spouses, widows/widowers, or mothers of certain deceased or disabled veterans (Derivative Preference).</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Key Benefits:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>10 points added to a passing score in examinations.</li>
            <li>Same general benefits and RIF protections as the CP category.</li>
            <li>For derivative preference, benefits depend on the veteran's status.</li>
          </ul>

        <section>
          <h2>Special Protections for CPS (30% or More Disabled) Veterans</h2>
          <p>Veterans entitled to 10-point preference based on a compensable service-connected disability of 30% or more (CPS) receive additional significant protections:</p>
          <h3>Agency "Pass Over" Protections</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>If an agency proposes to pass over a CPS veteran to select a non-preference eligible, it must notify both the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the veteran.</li>
            <li>The veteran has 15 days to respond to OPM.</li>
            <li>OPM must review the agency's reasons and the veteran's response, and make a final determination on whether the pass over is approved.</li>
            <li>OPM cannot delegate this authority to agencies.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Special Hiring Authorities</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>CPS veterans are eligible for non-competitive appointment under certain special hiring authorities, such as the 30% or More Disabled Veteran authority.</li>
            <li>This allows agencies to appoint eligible veterans to positions without competition.</li>
            <li>These appointments can be to temporary or term positions, and may be converted to career or career-conditional appointments.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How 10-Point Preference is Applied</h2>
          <h3>In Competitive Examinations (Numerical Scoring)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>CP/XP Veterans:</strong> 10 points are added to their passing score. They are listed ahead of non-preference eligibles with the same final score.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>CPS Veterans (30%+ disabled):</strong> 10 points are added to their passing score, and they are placed at the top of the list of eligibles, unless the position is scientific or professional at GS-9 or higher.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>In Category Rating</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Veterans are listed ahead of non-preference eligibles within each quality category (e.g., "Best Qualified," "Well Qualified").</li>
            <li>CPS veterans (30%+) must be considered by the hiring manager if they are in the highest quality category, even if there are other preference eligibles in that category.</li>
            <li>Agencies may not select a non-preference eligible over a preference eligible in the same category unless OPM approves a pass-over request.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>In Reduction in Force (RIF)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>CPS Veterans (30%+)</strong> are in retention Subgroup AD (the highest).
            </li>
            <li>Other 10-point preference eligibles (CP, XP) are typically in Subgroup A.</li>
            <li>Preference eligibles have higher retention standing than non-preference eligibles.</li>
            <li>CPS veterans have enhanced "bump and retreat" rights, potentially retreating up to 5 grades (vs. 3 grades for other preference eligibles).</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Common Questions about 10-Point Preference</h2>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>Q: My VA disability rating changed. What should I do for federal job applications?</h3>
            <p>A: You must submit updated documentation reflecting your new rating. If your rating increased to 30% or more, you would qualify for CPS status, which offers greater protections. Ensure your VA letter is current (dated within 12 months).</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>Q: Can I claim 10-point preference if I'm still on active duty?</h3>
            <p>A: Under the VOW (Veterans Opportunity to Work) Act, you can apply for federal jobs within 120 days of your scheduled discharge. You'll need a "certification" letter from your command stating your expected discharge date and character of service. You must provide your final DD-214 and other preference documents (like SF-15 and VA letter, if applicable) before you can be appointed.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>Q: Do I need to submit an SF-15 for every job I apply for?</h3>
            <p>A: Yes, generally you need to submit a completed SF-15 and all supporting documentation with each application where you are claiming 10-point preference. Check the job announcement for specific instructions.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>Q: What's the main difference between CP (Compensable Preference 10-29%) and XP (Disability Preference, e.g., Purple Heart or 0% rating)?</h3>
            <p>A: Both add 10 points. CP is specifically for veterans with a VA disability rating of 10% or 20%. XP covers a broader group, including Purple Heart recipients, those with a 0% service-connected disability, those receiving VA pension, or those with military disability retirement. CPS (30% or more) provides the most benefits, placing veterans at the top of lists and offering pass-over protection.</p>

          <h2>Important Reminders</h2>
          <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Points</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Claiming 10-point preference always requires completing and submitting the SF-15 form along with supporting documentation.</li>
              <li>Documentation for disability (e.g., VA letters) must be current, typically dated within one year of application.</li>
              <li>CPS (30% or more disabled) preference provides the strongest advantages and protections in federal hiring.</li>
              <li>You cannot receive both 5-point and 10-point preference; 10-point preference, if eligible, supersedes 5-point.</li>
              <li>Retired military officers at the rank of Major/Lieutenant Commander (O-4) or above are generally not eligible for preference unless they are disabled veterans.</li>
            </ul>
