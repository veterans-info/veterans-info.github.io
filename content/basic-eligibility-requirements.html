            <h2>Basic Eligibility Requirements</h2>
            <p>To be eligible for Veterans' Preference in federal employment, individuals must meet specific criteria related to their military service. These fundamental requirements form the basis for all preference claims.</p>
            
            <h3>General Conditions for Preference:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Honorable Discharge:</strong> Service must have been performed under honorable conditions, as evidenced by a Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (DD Form 214).</li>
                <li><strong>Active Duty Service:</strong> Generally, preference applies to veterans who served on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces. This typically excludes service in the National Guard or Reserves unless it was for a period of active duty for training or for a period of active duty for other than training.</li>
                <li><strong>Specific Service Periods or Campaigns:</strong> Eligibility often depends on the dates of service or participation in specific military campaigns or expeditions. For example, service during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Points to Consider:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Length of Service:</strong> For some preference categories, a minimum length of active duty service is required.</li>
                <li><strong>Disability Status:</strong> Veterans with service-connected disabilities may be eligible for different types of preference (e.g., 10-point preference).</li>
                <li><strong>Receipt of Campaign Badge:</strong> Service in certain campaigns or expeditions, even for short durations, can confer preference eligibility if a campaign badge has been awarded.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is crucial to review your DD Form 214 and any other relevant military documents to confirm your eligibility.
