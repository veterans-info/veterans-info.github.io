            <h2>Special Appointing Authorities for Veterans</h2>
            <p>Beyond Veterans' Preference, several special appointing authorities exist to help veterans gain federal employment. These authorities allow agencies to hire eligible veterans non-competitively or with streamlined processes.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Appointing Authorities:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Veterans Recruitment Appointment (VRA):</strong> Allows agencies to appoint eligible veterans without competition up to the GS-11 level (or equivalent). Veterans must meet specific service requirements and be honorably discharged.</li>
                <li><strong>30% or More Disabled Veteran:</strong> Permits agencies to non-competitively appoint veterans with a 30% or more service-connected disability. There is no grade-level restriction for this authority.</li>
                <li><strong>Disabled Veterans Enrolled in a VA Training Program:</strong> Allows agencies to appoint veterans who are receiving training under the VA's vocational rehabilitation program.</li>
                <li><strong>Veterans Employment Opportunity Act (VEOA):</strong> Provides eligible veterans with the opportunity to compete for positions announced under agency merit promotion procedures when the agency is recruiting from outside its own workforce.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Benefits of Special Authorities:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Streamlined Hiring:</strong> Reduces the time and complexity of the hiring process for both agencies and veterans.</li>
                <li><strong>Increased Opportunities:</strong> Opens up additional pathways to federal service for eligible veterans.</li>
                <li><strong>Targeted Recruitment:</strong> Enables agencies to specifically target and hire veterans for various roles.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is important for veterans to understand which appointing authorities they may be eligible for and to clearly state their eligibility when applying for federal jobs.
