            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <p>Here are some frequently asked questions regarding Veterans' Preference in federal employment, derived from the OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals.</p>
            
            <h3>Q: What is Veterans' Preference?</h3>
            <p>A: Veterans' Preference is a statutory entitlement granting eligible veterans preference in hiring for federal jobs over non-veterans. It applies to appointments in the competitive service and to appointments in the excepted service where the hiring agency has elected to apply it.</p>

            <h3>Q: Who is eligible for Veterans' Preference?</h3>
            <p>A: Generally, veterans who served on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces and were separated under honorable conditions are eligible. Specific eligibility criteria depend on the dates of service, campaign participation, and presence of service-connected disabilities. Refer to the <a href="eligibility-overview.html">Eligibility Overview</a> section for more details.</p>

            <h3>Q: How is Veterans' Preference applied?</h3>
            <p>A: Preference is applied by adding points to passing scores on examinations or by placing veterans ahead of non-veterans on hiring lists. The specific application varies depending on the type of preference and the hiring authority used.</p>

            <h3>Q: What documentation is required to claim Veterans' Preference?</h3>
            <p>A: Typically, a DD-214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty) is required. For 10-point preference, additional documentation such as a VA letter confirming service-connected disability or a Purple Heart citation may be needed. Our <a href="../tool.html">Interactive Guide</a> can help you determine the specific documents required for your situation.</p>

            <h3>Q: Does Veterans' Preference guarantee a job?</h3>
            <p>A: No, Veterans' Preference does not guarantee a job. It provides an advantage in the hiring process by adding points to scores or by placing eligible veterans higher on hiring lists. Qualified veterans must still meet the minimum qualifications for the position and successfully compete with other applicants.</p>
