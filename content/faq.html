        <section>
          <h2>General Veterans' Preference Questions</h2>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>What is Veterans' Preference?</h3>
            <p>Veterans' Preference is a system established by law that gives eligible veterans and certain family members an advantage over non-veteran applicants in federal hiring processes and during reductions in force (RIF). It aims to recognize the economic loss suffered by citizens who served in the military, restore veterans to a favorable competitive position for government employment, and acknowledge the particular obligation owed to disabled veterans.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>Does Veterans' Preference guarantee me a federal job?</h3>
            <p>No. Veterans' Preference provides an advantage in hiring, but it does not guarantee a job. Applicants must still meet the minimum qualification requirements for the position and compete with other qualified applicants. Federal agencies can use various hiring authorities, and preference does not compel them to select a veteran if other candidates are deemed better qualified under certain rules.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>Does Veterans' Preference apply to all federal jobs?</h3>
            <p>No. Veterans' Preference generally applies to most permanent and temporary positions in the competitive and excepted services of the executive branch. However, it typically does not apply to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Positions in the Senior Executive Service (SES).</li>
              <li>Executive branch positions that require Senate confirmation.</li>
              <li>Positions in the legislative and judicial branches (unless specifically provided for by statute).</li>
              <li>Certain specific excepted service positions as defined by OPM or statute.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>Can I use Veterans' Preference for promotions or internal job changes?</h3>
            <p>No. Veterans' Preference does not apply to internal agency actions such as promotions, reassignments, changes to a lower grade, transfers between federal agencies, or reinstatements for current or former federal employees. It primarily applies to initial appointments from outside the federal service.</p>
          </div>
        </section>
        <!-- Eligibility Questions -->
        <section>
          <h2>Eligibility Questions</h2>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>I only served during peacetime. Am I eligible for preference?</h3>
            <p>Eligibility for peacetime service depends on the period of service and other factors:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If you served for more than 180 consecutive days, any part of which occurred between January 31, 1955, and October 15, 1976, you generally qualify for 5-point preference.</li>
              <li>If your *only* active duty service was after October 14, 1976 (and not during the Gulf War period August 2, 1990 - January 2, 1992), you typically qualify for preference *only if* you are a disabled veteran or you received a campaign or expeditionary medal.</li>
              <li>All veterans with a compensable service-connected disability (0% or more) are generally eligible regardless of when they served.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>Does my Reserve or National Guard service qualify for Veterans' Preference?</h3>
            <p>Only active duty service (not active duty for training) generally counts towards Veterans' Preference. However:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If you were called or ordered to active duty under Title 10 of the U.S. Code for federal service (e.g., for a contingency operation), that period of active duty counts.</li>
              <li>If you incurred a service-connected disability or died as a result of injury or disease incurred or aggravated during any period of military service, including active duty for training, you (or your eligible family members) may qualify for 10-point preference.</li>
              <li>Typical annual training (two weeks) and weekend drills (inactive duty training) do not, by themselves, qualify for preference.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>I'm a military retiree. Can I still claim Veterans' Preference?</h3>
            <p>Eligibility for military retirees depends on their retired rank:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Retired at a rank below O-4 (Major/Lieutenant Commander):</strong> Yes, generally eligible for preference.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Retired at the rank of O-4 or above:</strong> Generally eligible for preference *only if* you are a disabled veteran (i.e., have a service-connected disability).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Enlisted retirees:</strong> Generally always eligible for preference.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note: Members of the Reserves or National Guard who are entitled to retired pay at age 60 but have not yet reached that age are not considered "retired" for preference purposes until they begin drawing retired pay.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>What type of discharge characterization do I need?</h3>
            <p>To be eligible for Veterans' Preference, you must have been discharged or released from active duty under honorable conditions. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>An Honorable discharge.</li>
              <li>A General discharge (Under Honorable Conditions).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Discharges characterized as Other Than Honorable (OTH), Bad Conduct, or Dishonorable do NOT qualify for Veterans' Preference.</p>
          </div>
        </section>
        <!-- Documentation Questions -->
        <section>
          <h2>Documentation Questions</h2>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>What is a DD-214, and why is it essential?</h3>
            <p>The DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty, is the primary document used to verify military service for most benefits, including Veterans' Preference. It contains crucial information such as your dates of service, character of discharge, and any campaign medals or awards received. For preference, you generally need to provide a copy that shows the characterization of your discharge (e.g., Member Copy 4 or Service-2 copy).</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>How can I obtain my DD-214 if I've lost it?</h3>
            <p>You can request a copy of your DD-214 from the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) through several methods:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Online:</strong> Visit the National Archives website at <a href="https://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.archives.gov/veterans</a>.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Mail:</strong> Complete Standard Form (SF) 180, Request Pertaining to Military Records, and mail it to the NPRC.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>In person:</strong> Your local VA office or some Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs) may be able to assist you.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>Is submitting an SF-15 form always required?</h3>
            <p>The SF-15, Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference, is required *only* if you are claiming any type of 10-point preference. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Veterans with a service-connected disability (CP, CPS, XP disability categories).</li>
              <li>Veterans who are Purple Heart recipients (XP).</li>
              <li>Eligible spouses, widows/widowers, and mothers claiming derivative preference (XP).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you are claiming only 5-point preference (TP), you do NOT need to submit an SF-15. Your DD-214 is usually sufficient.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>My VA disability rating has changed. Do I need updated documentation?</h3>
            <p>Yes. You must provide current documentation reflecting your new VA disability rating. Obtain an official letter from the VA stating your current disability percentage. This letter should ideally be dated within the last 12 months. If your rating increased to 30% or more, you might qualify for CPS preference, which offers greater protections and advantages than other preference types.</p>
          </div>
        </section>
        <!-- Application Process Questions -->
        <section>
          <h2>Application Process Questions</h2>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>When and how should I claim Veterans' Preference?</h3>
            <p>You should claim Veterans' Preference every time you apply for a federal job for which you are eligible. Indicate your claim on your resume, select the appropriate preference type in online application systems like USAJOBS, and submit all required supporting documentation as specified in the job announcement.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>I'm still on active duty. Can I apply for federal jobs before I separate?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Under the provisions of the VOW (Veterans Opportunity to Work) Act, service members who are within 120 days of their scheduled separation or retirement date can apply for federal positions. You will need to provide:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A "certification" letter from your command on official letterhead.</li>
              <li>This letter must state your branch of service, dates of active duty, expected date of discharge/release, and the character of service expected.</li>
              <li>You must provide your official DD-214 (and other preference documents if applicable) before you can be appointed.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>Can I claim both Veterans Readjustment Appointment (VRA) and Veterans' Preference?</h3>
            <p>VRA and Veterans' Preference are distinct. VRA is a special hiring authority allowing agencies to non-competitively appoint eligible veterans to positions up to GS-11 (or equivalent). Veterans' Preference applies to competitive hiring processes.</p>
            <p>You can be eligible for both. An agency might consider you under VRA for a non-competitive appointment or through a competitive process where your Veterans' Preference would apply. Claiming one does not preclude eligibility for the other if you meet the criteria for both.</p>
          </div>
        </section>
        <!-- Special Situations -->
        <section>
          <h2>Special Situations & Protections</h2>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>What is "derivative preference," and who is eligible?</h3>
            <p>Derivative preference is a 10-point preference (XP) that can be granted to certain family members when the veteran is unable to use the preference themselves due to a qualifying service-connected disability or death. Eligible family members include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Spouses of living veterans who are unable to work due to a total and permanent service-connected disability.</li>
              <li>Unremarried widows or widowers of certain deceased veterans.</li>
              <li>Mothers of veterans who died in service or are permanently and totally disabled (under specific conditions related to her marital/dependency status).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Importantly, children of veterans are NOT eligible for derivative preference.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>What are "pass over" rights for veterans with a 30% or more disability?</h3>
            <p>Veterans entitled to preference based on a compensable service-connected disability of 30% or more (CPS category) have significant protections. If a hiring agency proposes to "pass over" such a veteran (i.e., select a non-preference eligible instead from a certificate of eligibles):</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The agency must notify both the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the veteran in writing of its reasons.</li>
              <li>The veteran has 15 days to respond to OPM.</li>
              <li>OPM must review the case and make a final determination on whether to approve the pass over.</li>
              <li>This authority for OPM to approve or deny pass over requests for CPS veterans cannot be delegated to the hiring agency.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>How does Veterans' Preference work in a Reduction in Force (RIF)?</h3>
            <p>In a RIF, preference eligibles have higher retention standing than non-preference eligibles. This means they are generally the last to be separated or downgraded. Employees are ranked on retention registers by:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Tenure group (e.g., career employees before term employees).</li>
              <li>Veterans' Preference status (preference eligibles are in higher subgroups). <ul>
                  <li>Subgroup AD: 30% or more disabled veterans (highest).</li>
                  <li>Subgroup A: Other preference eligibles.</li>
                  <li>Subgroup B: Non-preference eligibles.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Length of service (within the subgroup).</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

        <!-- Common Misconceptions -->
        <section>
          <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>Does Veterans' Preference apply to jobs with federal contractors?</h3>
            <p>No. Veterans' Preference laws apply to federal civil service employment. They do not apply to employment with private companies, including those that are federal contractors. However, many federal contractors an VEVRAA requirements have goals for hiring veterans and may voluntarily give some form of preference.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>Can a veteran "lose" their Veterans' Preference entitlement?</h3>
            <p>The entitlement to Veterans' Preference itself is permanent for eligible veterans and does not "expire." However:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>It applies mainly to initial appointments, not to promotions or other internal agency actions once an individual is a federal employee.</li>
              <li>Eligibility for derivative preference can end if circumstances change (e.g., a widow remarries).</li>
              <li>Misrepresenting eligibility can lead to removal and potential penalties.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>Is "veteran status" the same as "Veterans' Preference eligibility"?</h3>
            <p>No. While related, they are not identical. "Veteran status" generally refers to anyone who served honorably in the military. "Veterans' Preference eligibility" is a legal entitlement with specific criteria based on when, where, and how one served, or if one has a service-connected disability. Not all individuals with veteran status are eligible for Veterans' Preference.</p>
