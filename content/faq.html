            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
            <p>Here are some frequently asked questions regarding Veterans' Preference in federal employment. For definitive answers, always refer to the official OPM Vet Guide.</p>

            <h3>Q: What is Veterans' Preference?</h3>
            <p>A: Veterans' preference is a statutory entitlement granted to eligible veterans in recognition of their service to the nation. It provides a preference in hiring for federal jobs over non-preference eligibles.</p>

            <h3>Q: Who is eligible for Veterans' Preference?</h3>
            <p>A: Eligibility generally depends on honorable active duty service in the U.S. Armed Forces, during specific periods or in certain campaigns, or having a service-connected disability. Spouses, widows, and mothers of certain deceased or disabled veterans may also be eligible for derivative preference.</p>

            <h3>Q: How do I claim Veterans' Preference?</h3>
            <p>A: To claim Veterans' Preference, you typically need to provide documentation such as your DD-214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty) and, if applicable, a VA disability letter. Specific requirements can vary by agency and job announcement.</p>

            <h3>Q: Does Veterans' Preference guarantee me a job?</h3>
            <p>A: No, Veterans' Preference does not guarantee a job. It places eligible veterans ahead of non-preference eligibles in the hiring process, but it does not exempt them from meeting job qualifications or competing with other preference eligibles.</p>

            <h3>Q: Where can I find the official OPM Vet Guide?</h3>
            <p>A: The official OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals can be found on the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) website: <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/veterans-services/vet-guide-for-hr-professionals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals</a>.</p>
