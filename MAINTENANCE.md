# Website Maintenance Procedures

This document outlines the procedures for ongoing maintenance of the veterans-info.github.io website.

## Content Update Monitoring

To ensure the website's information remains current and accurate, especially regarding the OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, the following manual monitoring system is established:

1.  **Monthly OPM Website Check:**
    *   Visit the official OPM website (specifically the Veterans Services section and the Vet Guide for HR Professionals page) at least once a month.
    *   Look for any announcements, revisions, or new versions of the Vet Guide.
    *   Record the date of the check and any findings.

2.  **RSS Feed/Newsletter Subscription:**
    *   Subscribe to relevant government RSS feeds or newsletters that provide updates on federal employment policies, veterans' affairs, or OPM guidance.
    *   Regularly review these subscriptions for any information pertinent to the website's content.

3.  **Documentation of Updates:**
    *   Maintain a log of all OPM guide updates identified.
    *   For each update, record:
        *   Date identified
        *   Source of update (e.g., OPM website, newsletter)
        *   Summary of changes
        *   Impact on website content (which pages need revision)
        *   Date website content was updated to reflect the changes
    *   This log will serve as an audit trail for content accuracy.

This process ensures that the website's content remains aligned with the latest official guidance from the Office of Personnel Management.

## Link Maintenance Strategy

To ensure the integrity and accuracy of external links, particularly those to OPM resources, the following strategy is implemented:

1.  **External Link Documentation:**
    *   Maintain a record (e.g., a spreadsheet or dedicated document) of all external links used on the website, especially those pointing to OPM resources.
    *   For each link, record: the URL, the page(s) where it's used, and a brief description of its purpose.

2.  **Quarterly Link Checks:**
    *   Perform manual checks of all external links at least once every quarter.
    *   Utilize browser extensions (e.g., "Check My Links" for Chrome/Firefox) or online link checkers to identify broken or redirected links.

3.  **Documentation of Checking Process and Results:**
    *   Maintain a log of each link check, including:
        *   Date of check
        *   Tool(s) used
        *   Number of links checked
        *   Number of broken/redirected links found
        *   Actions taken (e.g., link updated, content revised, note added)
    *   This log serves as an audit trail for link integrity.

4.  **Calendar Reminders:**
    *   Set recurring calendar reminders for quarterly link reviews to ensure consistency and timely maintenance.

This strategy helps maintain the reliability and trustworthiness of the information provided on the website by ensuring all external references are current and accessible.
