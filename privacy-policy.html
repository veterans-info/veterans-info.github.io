          <h2>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h2>
          <p>Welcome to the Veterans' Preference Guide (referred to as "we," "our," or "this website"). This website, hosted on GitHub Pages at <a href="https://veterans-info.github.io" rel="noopener noreferrer">veterans-info.github.io</a>, is dedicated to providing informational resources. We are strongly committed to protecting your privacy and collecting as little information as possible. </p>
          <p>This Privacy Policy outlines our practices regarding information related to your use of this website. By using this website, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>What Information We DO NOT Collect</h2>
          <p>This website is designed to be a privacy-respecting resource. We **DO NOT**:
          <ul>
            <li>Require you to create an account or log in to access information.</li>
            <li>Use tracking cookies, advertising cookies, or third-party analytics services (like Google Analytics) to monitor your behavior across the web. Your `script.js` confirms no active analytics are implemented.</li>
            <li>Sell or rent any user information to third parties.</li>
            <li>Collect any personal information through our "Veterans' Preference Interactive Guide" tool that is sent to or stored on any server. All tool processing is client-side.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

          <h2>Information We Collect (and Why)</h2>
          <h3>1. Information Automatically Logged by GitHub Pages (Our Hosting Provider)</h3>
          <p>This website is hosted on GitHub Pages. As part of its standard operation, GitHub Pages may automatically collect and log certain technical information when you visit our site. This typically includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your IP address (which may be anonymized or truncated by GitHub).</li>
            <li>The type of browser and operating system you are using.</li>
            <li>The date and time of your visit.</li>
            <li>The pages you visited on our site.</li>
            <li>The referring website (if you came from another site).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This information is collected by GitHub for operational purposes, such as monitoring traffic, ensuring security, and generating aggregated, non-identifying statistics about website usage. We, as the site owners, may have limited access to these aggregated statistics through GitHub. We do not use this data to personally identify you. For more details on how GitHub handles this data, please refer to the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Privacy Statement</a>. </p>
          <h3>2. Information You Voluntarily Provide (Email Contact)</h3>
          <p>The only way we collect personally identifiable information through this website is if you voluntarily choose to contact us via the provided email address ( <a href="mailto:feedback@veterans-info.github.io">feedback@veterans-info.github.io</a>). If you email us, we will have access to: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your email address.</li>
            <li>Any other information you include in your email communication.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We use this information solely to:
          <ul>
            <li>Respond to your specific inquiries, questions, or feedback.</li>
            <li>Improve our website and services based on your suggestions, if any.</li>
          </ul> We do not share this information with third parties unless required by law. Email communications are handled through standard email protocols and are subject to the inherent security risks of email. </p>
          <h3>3. "Veterans' Preference Interactive Guide" Tool Data</h3>
          <p>Our interactive eligibility guide tool is designed with your privacy as a top priority. As confirmed by reviewing `tool.js`:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>All processing is local:</strong> The tool processes all the information you enter directly within your web browser (client-side).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No data transmission:</strong> Your answers and the results generated by the tool are **NOT** transmitted to our server, GitHub's servers, or any third-party server.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No data storage:</strong> The tool **DOES NOT** store any of your answers or results persistently on any server. All data related to your use of the tool is cleared from your browser's memory for that session when you close the browser tab/window, navigate away from the tool page, or use the "Start Over" button within the tool.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The purpose of this tool is solely to provide you with information based on your inputs, which remain entirely under your control and within your browser session.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Cookies</h2>
          <p>This website itself **DOES NOT** set or use cookies for tracking, advertising, or analytics purposes.</p>
          <p>GitHub Pages, as the hosting platform, may use essential cookies for the basic functionality and security of the service (e.g., session cookies). These are typically deleted when you close your browser and are not used by us to track your activity across other sites. You can manage cookie preferences through your browser settings.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>This website consists of static files hosted on GitHub Pages. We do not operate our own databases or servers that store user data generated from website visits.</li>
            <li>Information you send via email is stored within our email system with standard security measures appropriate for email.</li>
            <li>While we strive to protect any information you share with us, please be aware that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
          <p>Our website contains links to external, third-party websites for informational purposes (e.g., OPM.gov, VA.gov, USAJOBS.gov). This Privacy Policy applies only to our website ( <a href="https://veterans-info.github.io" rel="noopener noreferrer">veterans-info.github.io</a>). </p>
          <p>We are not responsible for the privacy practices, content, or security of these external sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
          <p>This website is not intended for or directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information promptly.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
          <p>Since we collect minimal personal information, your primary rights include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Accessing and using our website without providing any personal information (other than what GitHub Pages may automatically log as described above).</li>
            <li>Choosing not to contact us via email if you do not wish to share your email address or other information.</li>
            <li>Using browser settings to manage or block cookies (though this should have minimal impact on our site's functionality as we don't rely on non-essential cookies).</li>
            <li>If you have contacted us via email, you may request to see the information you provided or ask for its deletion, subject to any legal requirements for us to retain it.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Do Not Track (DNT)</h2>
          <p>This website respects "Do Not Track" (DNT) browser settings. As we do not engage in tracking users ourselves, enabling DNT in your browser aligns with our privacy practices. GitHub Pages' handling of DNT signals would be subject to their own policies.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>California Privacy Rights (CCPA)</h2>
          <p>If you are a California resident, you have specific rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). However, as this website does not "sell" personal information (as defined by the CCPA) and collects very limited personal information (only through voluntary email contact), many CCPA provisions regarding extensive data collection and sale are not directly applicable. If you have questions regarding your CCPA rights in relation to any data you may have voluntarily provided via email, please contact us.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>International Users</h2>
          <p>This website is hosted in the United States and is primarily intended for users in the United States. If you access our website from outside the U.S., please be aware that any information GitHub Pages collects or information you voluntarily provide may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States, where data protection laws may differ from those in your country.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date at the top.</p>
          <p>We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.</p>
