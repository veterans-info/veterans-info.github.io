## 🚀 What is Veterans' Preference?

Veterans' Preference is a system of laws passed by Congress that provides eligible veterans and certain family members with advantages in federal hiring. It recognizes the economic loss suffered by citizens who have served their country in uniform, restores veterans to a favorable competitive position, and acknowledges the larger obligation owed to disabled veterans.

### Key Benefits Include:
- Additional points added to examination scores
- Preference in retention during workforce reductions
- Special appointing authorities for certain positions
- Appeal rights in certain adverse employment actions
